						RECOMMENDATION

1. Optimize delivery routes: Since there is a positive relationship between the average delivery time and pizza quantity,
   it is essential to optimize delivery routes to minimize delivery times. Implementing efficient route planning can help
   reduce overall delivery times.

2. Offer promotions on Fridays: As the data indicates that Fridays have the lowest number of orders, consider offering 
   promotions or discounts specifically targeted for Fridays to incentivize customers and boost order volumes on that day.

3. Analyze customer preferences: Further analyze customer preferences for Meat Lover and Vegetarian pizzas to understand 
   the demand patterns better. This can help in adjusting the inventory and ingredients accordingly to meet customer 
   expectations and maximize customer satisfaction.

4. Provide incentives for runners: Acknowledge and reward the top-performing runner, such as Runner 1, who has the highest
   number of successful deliveries. This can help motivate and retain efficient runners while encouraging healthy 
   competition among the delivery team.

5. Explore marketing opportunities: Given that most orders occur on Saturdays and Wednesdays, consider allocating marketing
   efforts and resources towards these peak days. This can involve targeted advertising campaigns, promotions, or 
   partnerships to further drive customer engagement and increase order volumes.
